# LED PhaseShifter
<img src="assets/LED-PhaseShifter thumbnail.jpg" alt="Game Thumbnail" width="500"/> 
**LED PhaseShifter** is real-time LED control project for the **STM32L476RG** using interrupts, SysTick, and GPIO to control 16 external LEDs. Features dual operating modes: FLASH mode for alternating LED animation and MOVE mode for manual LED shifting.

## Features
üîÑ **Dual operating modes**
  - **FLASH LED MODE** ‚Äì LEDs flash in alternating left/right pattern with an adjustable frequnecy from 1 Hz to 16 Hz
  - **MOVE LED MODE** ‚Äì Manual LED control for shifting the LED left and right based on button input

‚ö° **User-Driven Controls**
- In **FLASH LED MODE**:
  - Left button: Halves Frequency
  - Right button: Doubles Frequency
- In **MOVE LED MODE**:
  - Left button: shifts LED position left
  - Right button: shifts LED position right

üîÅ **Instant response mode switching**
 - Pressing the built-in USER button instantly toggles between FLASH LED MODE and MOVE LED MODE

üïí **Real-time processing with timers**
  - TIM2 used to control LED animation
  - SysTick used for millisecond timekeeping and debouncing
    
üëÜ **Interrupt-based input handling**
  - External interrupts on PA1, PA4, and PC13
  - Software debouncing ensures clean button logic
    
üß™ **Bare-Metal Embedded C**
  - Written without HAL; uses direct register manipulation (CMSIS)
